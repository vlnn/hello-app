# cljd_hello_app

A new Flutter project.

## Why

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I'm a simple man, so I need to frequently see what did I do in past, and how it was done. This should support this need.

## How

``` fish
clj -M:cljd flutter -d macos # to run in macos desktop env
clj -M:cljd flutter -d iphone-sim # to run in iphone desktop env
```
